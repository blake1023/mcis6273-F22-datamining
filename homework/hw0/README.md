1. **What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?**

- One of the things that interested me is getting into data science. During my last summer interships, one of my supervisor was a Data Engineer and the other was a Machine Learning Engineer. Which probably influenced me enough to have considered getting into data science, data engineering, and Machine Learning engineering. What I would like to accomplish with this course is to have some more exposure to Jupyter Labs (had some exposure during my intership) and would like to be able to analyze complex data to understand the implementation of the data in a useful way.

2. **Podcast Questions**
- *Thing I learned from the podcast*\
One thing I did't know was that jupyter can have widgets to provide better was to display data. Javascript has poor support for compuational analysis (libaries) while python and R has good support. Data Analysis in general is not getting viewed in Excel and now is getting viewed via programming tools like Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks are byscailly JSON files. Jupyter is a compination of Julia, python, and R (literary in the name). There is a lot of information and notebooks on github which is seems to be the best way to get data.

- *Some thing I agree On*\
I definitely agree with Adam with Python having great computional/mathmatical analysis support. Personally, I believe Python is probably the simplest yet complex high level language to write code. Python has access to panda libaries which is great for data manipulation. Also, later in the podcast they mentioned 96%  of notebooks are written in Python.
- *Inerest in Jupyter notebooks on github*\
I mentioned earlier that I have some exposure to Jupyter notebooks but would definitely would like to enchanched my knowledge of Jupyter notebooks. Getting into gathering data from GitHub and analyze the data is something that peaks my interest as well. Maybe even getting into a little bit of R programming and pnadas libaries as well since they mentioned that in the podcast quite frequently.
